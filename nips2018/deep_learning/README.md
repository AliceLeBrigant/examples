This example illustrates training of mnist on an hypersphere manifold.

## Installation

The installation of this example is currently quite involved. You will need to:

- Update tensorflow from a patch file in this repository (re-compiling would be a nightmare - this solution is a hack but it is the least painful path for now.). You will also need a fairly recent version of tensorflow (1.8 at least).
- Update keras (the following steps are just if you've never installed keras - you might want to uninstall it before re-installing this version):
```
cd keras/
python3 setup.py
```

## Running
